        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-2">PyTorch Edge</h2>
        <p>The AI landscape is quickly evolving, with AI models being deployed beyond servers to edge devices such as mobile phones, wearables, AR/VR/MR and embedded devices. PyTorch Edge extends PyTorch's research-to-production stack to these edge devices and paves the way for building innovative, privacy-aware experiences with superior productivity, portability, and performance, optimized for diverse hardware platforms.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-2">What is ExecuTorch?</h2>
        <p>ExecuTorch is an end-to-end solution for enabling on-device inference capabilities across mobile and edge devices including wearables, embedded devices and microcontrollers. It is part of the PyTorch Edge ecosystem and enables efficient deployment of various PyTorch models (vision, speech, Generative AI, and more) to edge devices.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-2">Why ExecuTorch?</h2>
        <p>Supporting on-device AI presents unique challenges with diverse hardware, critical power requirements, low/no internet connectivity, and realtime processing needs. These constraints have historically prevented or slowed down the creation of scalable and performant on-device AI solutions. ExecuTorch was developed collaboratively between industry leaders including Meta, Arm, Apple, and Qualcomm to be highly portable and provide superior developer productivity without compromising performance.</p>
