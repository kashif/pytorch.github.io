      <content type="html" xml:base="https://pytorch.org/blog/flashattention-3/">&lt;p&gt;Attention, as a core layer of the ubiquitous Transformer architecture, is a bottleneck for large language models and long-context applications. FlashAttention (and FlashAttention-2) pioneered an approach to speed up attention on GPUs by minimizing memory reads/writes, and is now used by most &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention.html&quot;&gt;libraries&lt;/a&gt; to accelerate Transformer training and inference. This has contributed to a massive increase in LLM context length in the last two years, from 2-4K (GPT-3, OPT) to 128K (GPT-4), or even 1M (&lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/gradientai/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Gradient-1048k&quot;&gt;Llama 3&lt;/a&gt;). However, despite its success, FlashAttention has yet to take advantage of new capabilities in modern hardware, with FlashAttention-2 achieving only 35% utilization of theoretical max FLOPs on the H100 GPU. In this blogpost, we describe three main techniques to speed up attention on Hopper GPUs: exploiting asynchrony of the Tensor Cores and TMA to (1) overlap overall computation and data movement via warp-specialization and (2) interleave block-wise matmul and softmax operations, and (3) incoherent processing that leverages hardware support for FP8 low-precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to release FlashAttention-3 that incorporates these techniques. It’s 1.5-2.0x faster than FlashAttention-2 with FP16, up to 740 TFLOPS, i.e., 75% utilization of H100 theoretical max FLOPS. With FP8, FlashAttention-3 reaches close to 1.2 PFLOPS, with 2.6x smaller error than baseline FP8 attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FlashAttention-3 is available at: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flashattention-recap&quot;&gt;FlashAttention Recap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135&quot;&gt;FlashAttention&lt;/a&gt; is an algorithm that reorders the attention computation and leverages tiling and recomputation to significantly speed it up and reduce memory usage from quadratic to linear in sequence length. We use tiling to load blocks of inputs from HBM (GPU memory) to SRAM (fast cache), perform attention with respect to that block, and update the output in HBM. By not writing the large intermediate attention matrices to HBM, we reduce the amount of memory reads/writes, which brings 2-4x wallclock time speedup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we show a diagram of FlashAttention forward pass: with tiling and softmax rescaling, we operate by blocks and avoid having to read/write from HBM, while obtaining the correct output with no approximation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-hardware-features-on-hopper-gpus---wgmma-tma-fp8&quot;&gt;New hardware features on Hopper GPUs - WGMMA, TMA, FP8&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While FlashAttention-2 can achieve up to 70% theoretical max FLOPS on Ampere (A100) GPUs, it does not yet take advantage of new features on Hopper GPUs to maximize performance. We describe some of the new Hopper-specific features here, and why they are important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. WGMMA (Warpgroup Matrix Multiply-Accumulate). This new feature makes use of the new Tensor Cores on Hopper, with much higher throughput&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; than the older mma.sync instruction in Ampere (image from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-tensor-core/gtc22-whitepaper-hopper?ncid=no-ncid&quot;&gt;H100 white paper)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flashattention-3/fg2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image from the H100 white paper&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. TMA (Tensor Memory Accelerator). This is a special hardware unit that accelerates the transfer of data between global memory and shared memory, taking care of all index calculation and out-of-bound predication. This frees up registers, which is a valuable resource to increase tile size and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flashattention-3/fg3.png&quot; alt=&quot;block diagram&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Low-precision with FP8. This doubles the Tensor Core throughput (e.g. 989 TFLOPS with FP16 and 1978 TFLOPS with FP8), but trades off accuracy by using fewer bits to represent floating point numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flashattention-3/fg4.png&quot; alt=&quot;6x throughput&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FlashAttention-3 makes use of all of these new features of Hopper, using powerful abstractions from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass&quot;&gt;NVIDIA’s CUTLASS&lt;/a&gt; library. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
By rewriting FlashAttention to use these new features, we can already significantly speed it up (e.g., from 350 TFLOPS in FlashAttention-2 FP16 forward pass to around 540-570 TFLOPS). However, the asynchronous nature of the new instructions on Hopper (WGMMA and TMA) opens up additional algorithmic opportunities to overlap operations and thereby extract even greater performance. For this blogpost, we’ll explain two such techniques specific to attention. The generic technique of warp specialization, with separate producer and consumer warps doing TMA and WGMMA, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/main/media/docs/efficient_gemm.md#warp-specialization&quot;&gt;well-covered elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; in the context of GEMM and works the same here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;asynchrony-overlapping-gemm-and-softmax&quot;&gt;Asynchrony: Overlapping GEMM and Softmax&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why overlap?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attention has GEMMs (those matmuls between Q and K and between attention probability P and V) and softmax as its two main operations. Why do we need to overlap them? Isn’t most of the FLOPS in the GEMMs anyway? As long as the GEMMs are fast (e.g., computed using WGMMA instructions), shouldn’t the &lt;a href=&quot;https://horace.io/brrr_intro.html&quot;&gt;GPU be going brrrr&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that non-matmul operations are much slower than matmul operations on modern accelerators. Special functions such as exponential (for the softmax) have even lower throughput than floating point multiply-add; they are evaluated by the multi-function unit, a unit separate from floating point multiply-add or matrix multiply-add. As an example, the H100 GPU SXM5 has 989 TFLOPS of FP16 matrix multiply, but only 3.9 TFLOPS (256x less throughput) for special functions&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;! For head dimension 128, there are 512x more matmul FLOPS than exponential, which means that exponential can take 50% of the time compared to matmul. The situation is even worse for FP8, where the matmul FLOPS are twice as fast yet exponential FLOPS stay the same speed. Ideally we want matmul and softmax to operate in parallel. While the Tensor Cores are busy with matmul, the multi-function units should be calculating exponential!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inter-warpgroup-overlapping-with-pingpong-scheduling&quot;&gt;Inter-warpgroup overlapping with pingpong scheduling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and easiest way to overlap GEMM and softmax is to do nothing at all! The warp schedulers already try to schedule warps so that if some warps are blocked (e.g., waiting for GEMM results), other warps can run. That is, the warp schedulers do some of this overlapping for us, for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we can improve on this by doing some of the scheduling manually. As an example, if we have 2 warpgroups (labeled 1 and 2 – each warpgroup is a group of 4 warps), we can use synchronization barriers (bar.sync) so that warpgroup 1 first does its GEMMs (e.g., GEMM1 of one iteration and GEMM0 of the next iteration), and then warpgroup 2 does its GEMMs while warpgroup 1 does its softmax, and so on. This “pingpong” schedule is illustrated in the figure below, where the same color denotes the same iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flashattention-3/fg5.png&quot; alt=&quot;block chart&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would allow us to perform the softmax in the shadow of the GEMMs of the other warpgroup. Of course, this figure is just a caricature; in practice the scheduling is not really this clean. Nevertheless, pingpong scheduling can improve FP16 attention forward pass from around 570 TFLOPS to 620 TFLOPS (head dim 128, seqlen 8K).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intra-warpgroup-overlapping-of-gemm-and-softmax&quot;&gt;Intra-warpgroup overlapping of GEMM and Softmax&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even within one warpgroup, we can have some part of softmax running while the GEMMs of that warpgroup is running. This is illustrated in this figure, where the same color denotes the same iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flashattention-3/fg6.png&quot; alt=&quot;block chart&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pipelining increases throughput from around 620 TFLOPS to around 640-660 TFLOPS for FP16 attention forward, at the cost of higher register pressure. We need more registers to hold both accumulators of the GEMMs, and the input/output of softmax. Overall, we find this technique to offer a favorable tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;low-precision-reduce-quantization-error-with-incoherent-processing&quot;&gt;Low-precision: reduce quantization error with incoherent processing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LLM activation can have &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07339&quot;&gt;outliers&lt;/a&gt; with much larger magnitude than the rest of the features. These outliers make it difficult to quantize, producing much larger quantization errors. We leverage incoherent processing, a technique used in the quantization literature (e.g. from &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13304&quot;&gt;QuIP&lt;/a&gt;) that multiplies the query and key with a random orthogonal matrix to “spread out” the outliers and reduce quantization error. In particular, we use the Hadamard transform (with random signs), which can be done per attention head in O(d log d) instead of O(d^2) time, where d is the head dimension. Since the Hadamard transform is memory-bandwidth bound, it can be fused with previous operations such as rotary embedding (also memory-bandwidth bound) “for free”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our experiment where Q, K, V are generated from a standard normal distribution but 0.1% of the entries have large magnitudes (to simulate outliers), we found that incoherent processing can reduce the quantization error by 2.6x. We show numerical error comparison in the table below. Please see the paper for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flashattention-3/fg6a.png&quot; alt=&quot;text diagram&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;attention-benchmark&quot;&gt;Attention benchmark&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We show some results with FlashAttention-3, and compare it to FlashAttention-2, as well as the implementation in Triton and cuDNN (both of which already use new hardware features of Hopper GPUs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For FP16, we see about 1.6x-1.8x speedup over FlashAttention-2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flashattention-3/fg7.png&quot; alt=&quot;speed charts&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flashattention-3/fg8.png&quot; alt=&quot;speed charts&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For FP8, we can reach close to 1.2 PFLOPS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flashattention-3/fg9.png&quot; alt=&quot;speed charts&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discussion&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blogpost highlights some of the optimizations for FlashAttention available on Hopper GPUs. Other optimizations (e.g., variable length sequences, persistent kernel, and in-kernel transpose for FP8) are covered in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen that designing algorithms that take advantage of the hardware they run on can bring significant efficiency gains and unlock new model capabilities such as long context. We look forward to future work on optimization for LLM inference, as well as generalizing our techniques to other hardware architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also look forward to FlashAttention-3 being integrated in a future release of PyTorch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Footnotes themselves at the bottom. --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Without the wgmma instruction, the older mma.sync instruction can only reach about ⅔ the peak throughput of Hopper Tensor Cores: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13499v1 &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The CUDA programming guide specifies that the throughput for special functions is 16 operations per streaming multiprocessor (SM) per clock cycle. We multiply 16 by 132 SMs and 1830 Mhz (clock speed used to calculate 989 TFLOPS of FP16 matmul) to get 3.9 TFLOPS &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <published>2024-07-09T00:00:00-07:00</published>
      <updated>2024-07-09T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
      <id>https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerated-pytorch-inference</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerated-pytorch-inference/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally PyTorch, used an eager mode where each PyTorch operation that forms the model is run independently as soon as it’s reached. PyTorch 2.0 introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torch_compile_tutorial.html&quot;&gt;torch.compile&lt;/a&gt; to speed up PyTorch code over the default eager mode. In contrast to eager mode, the torch.compile pre-compiles the entire model into a single graph in a manner that’s optimal for running on a given hardware platform. AWS optimized the PyTorch torch.compile feature for &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/05/amazon-ec2-c7g-instances-powered-aws-graviton3-processors/&quot;&gt;AWS Graviton3 processors&lt;/a&gt;. This optimization results in up to 2x better performance for &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/models&quot;&gt;Hugging Face&lt;/a&gt; model inference (based on geomean of performance improvement for 33 models) and up to 1.35x better performance for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pytorch/benchmark&quot;&gt;TorchBench&lt;/a&gt; model inference (geomean of performance improvement for 45 models) compared to the default eager mode inference across several natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and recommendation models on AWS Graviton3-based Amazon EC2 instances. Starting with PyTorch 2.3.1, the optimizations are available in torch Python &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/torch/2.3.1/&quot;&gt;wheels&lt;/a&gt; and AWS Graviton PyTorch &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/blob/master/available_images.md#ec2-framework-graviton-containers-ec2-ecs-and-eks-support-only&quot;&gt;deep learning container (DLC)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we show how we optimized torch.compile performance on AWS Graviton3-based EC2 instances, how to use the optimizations to improve inference performance, and the resulting speedups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-torchcompile-and-whats-the-goal&quot;&gt;Why torch.compile and what’s the goal?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In eager mode, operators in a model are run immediately as they are encountered. It’s easier to use, more suitable for machine learning (ML) researchers, and hence is the default mode. However, eager mode incurs runtime overhead because of redundant kernel launch and memory read overhead. Whereas in torch compile mode, operators are first synthesized into a graph, wherein one operator is merged with another to reduce and localize memory reads and total kernel launch overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal for the AWS Graviton team was to optimize torch.compile backend for Graviton3 processors. PyTorch eager mode was already optimized for Graviton3 processors with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ARM-software/ComputeLibrary&quot;&gt;Arm Compute Library (ACL)&lt;/a&gt; kernels using oneDNN (also known as MKLDNN). So, the question was, how to reuse those kernels in torch.compile mode to get the best of graph compilation and the optimized kernel performance together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AWS Graviton team extended the torch inductor and oneDNN primitives that reused the ACL kernels and optimized compile mode performance on Graviton3 processors. Starting with PyTorch 2.3.1, the optimizations are available in the torch Python wheels and AWS Graviton DLC. Please see the &lt;strong&gt;Running an inference&lt;/strong&gt; section that follows for the instructions on installation, runtime configuration, and how to run the tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the performance improvements, we used NLP, CV, and recommendation models from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pytorch/benchmark&quot;&gt;TorchBench&lt;/a&gt; and the most downloaded NLP models from &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/models&quot;&gt;Hugging Face&lt;/a&gt; across Question Answering, Text Classification, Token Classification, Translation, Zero-Shot Classification, Translation, Summarization, Feature Extraction, Text Generation, Text2Text Generation, Fill-Mask, and Sentence Similarity tasks to cover a wide variety of customer use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started with measuring TorchBench model inference latency, in milliseconds (msec), for the eager mode, which is marked 1.0 with a red dotted line in the following graph. Then we compared the improvements from torch.compile for the same model inference, the normalized results are plotted in the graph. You can see that for the 45 models we benchmarked, there is a 1.35x latency improvement (geomean for the 45 models).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image 1&lt;/strong&gt;: PyTorch model inference performance improvement with torch.compile on AWS Graviton3-based c7g instance using TorchBench framework. The reference eager mode performance is marked as 1.0. (higher is better)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the preceding TorchBench inference performance graph, we started with measuring the Hugging Face NLP model inference latency, in msec, for the eager mode, which is marked 1.0 with a red dotted line in the following graph. Then we compared the improvements from torch.compile for the same model inference, the normalized results are plotted in the graph. You can see that for the 33 models we benchmarked, there is around 2x performance improvement (geomean for the 33 models).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Hugging Face NLP model inference performance improvement with torch.compile on AWS Graviton3-based c7g instance using Hugging Face example scripts. The reference eager mode performance is marked as 1.0. (higher is better)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-an-inference&quot;&gt;Running an inference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with PyTorch 2.3.1, the optimizations are available in the torch Python wheel and in AWS Graviton PyTorch DLC. This section shows how to run inference in eager and torch.compile modes using torch Python wheels and benchmarking scripts from Hugging Face and TorchBench repos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To successfully run the scripts and reproduce the speedup numbers mentioned in this post, you need an instance from the Graviton3 family (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;c7g/r7g/m7g/hpc7g&lt;/code&gt;) of hardware. For this post, we used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c7g/&quot;&gt;c7g.4xl (16 vcpu) instance&lt;/a&gt;. The instance, the AMI details, and the required torch library versions are mentioned in the following snippet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generic runtime tunings implemented for eager mode inference are equally applicable for the torch.compile mode, so, we set the following environment variables to further improve the torch.compile performance on AWS Graviton3 processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google T5 Small Text Translation model is one of the around 30 Hugging Face models we benchmarked. We’re using it as a sample model to demonstrate how to run inference in eager and compile modes. The additional configurations and APIs required to run it in compile mode are highlighted in &lt;strong&gt;BOLD&lt;/strong&gt;. Save the following script as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;google_t5_small_text_translation.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the script with the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Set OMP_NUM_THREADS to number of vcpus to 4 because

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technical-deep-dive-what-are-the-challenges-and-optimization-details&quot;&gt;Technical deep dive: What are the challenges and optimization details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underpinning torch.compile are new technologies – TorchDynamo, AOTDispatcher, and TorchInductor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TorchDynamo&lt;/strong&gt; captures PyTorch programs safely using Python Frame Evaluation Hooks&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;AOTDispatcher&lt;/strong&gt; overloads PyTorch’s autograd engine as a tracing autodiff for generating ahead-of-time backward traces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;TorchInductor&lt;/strong&gt; is a deep learning compiler that generates fast code for multiple accelerators and backends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/accelerated-pytorch-inference/fg3.png&quot; alt=&quot;The PyTorch compilation process source&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image 3&lt;/strong&gt;: The PyTorch compilation process&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When torch.compile is invoked, torch dynamo rewrites Python bytecode to extract sequences of PyTorch operations into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fx.html&quot;&gt;FX&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fx.html&quot;&gt;Graph&lt;/a&gt;, which is then compiled with inductor backend. For a typical inference scenario where the graph is frozen and gradient calculations are disabled, the inductor invokes platform specific optimizations like graph rewrite into more performant operators, operator fusion, and weights pre-packing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, on Graviton3, the inductor wasn’t able to perform any of those optimizations because there was no aarch64 backend defined. To fix this, we extended the inductor’s FX passes to pick oneDNN operators for linear layer compilation on Graviton3 processors with ACL backend. The code snippet for this follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;packed_weight_op = (
    mkldnn._reorder_linear_weight
    if (is_bf16_weight or mkldnn._is_mkldnn_acl_supported())
                    
packed_linear_inputs: Tuple[Any, ...] = (input, packed_weight_node)
if is_bf16_weight or mkldnn._is_mkldnn_acl_supported():
    packed_linear_inputs += (bias, &quot;none&quot;, [], &quot;&quot;)
    packed_linear_op = mkldnn._linear_pointwise.default
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this was done, the FX pass was successful in compiling the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;matmul &lt;/code&gt;operators to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;linear_pointwise &lt;/code&gt;. The following snippet highlights the matmul operator in the original model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; %attention_scores   : [num_users=1] = call_function[target=torch.matmul](args = (%query_layer, %transpose), kwargs = {})
 %attention_scores_1 : [num_users=1] = call_function[target=operator.truediv](args = (%attention_scores, 8.0), kwargs = {})
 %attention_scores_2 : [num_users=1] = call_function[target=operator.add](args = (%attention_scores_1, %extended_attention_mask_3), kwargs = {})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following snippet highlights the linear_pointwise operator in the compiled graph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;%_linear_pointwise_default_140 : [num_users=2] = call_function[target=torch.ops.mkldnn._linear_pointwise.default](args = (%add_7, %_frozen_param278, %_frozen_param16, none, [], ), kwargs = {})
%mul_5 : [num_users=1] = call_function[target=torch.ops.aten.mul.Tensor](args = (%_linear_pointwise_default_140, 0.5), kwargs = {})
%mul_6 : [num_users=1] = call_function[target=torch.ops.aten.mul.Tensor](args = (%_linear_pointwise_default_140, 0.7071067811865476), kwargs = {})
%erf   : [num_users=1] = call_function[target=torch.ops.aten.erf.default](args = (%mul_6,), kwargs = {})
%add_8 : [num_users=1] = call_function[target=torch.ops.aten.add.Tensor](args = (%erf, 1), kwargs = {})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This completes the torch inductor changes required to compile the graph into optimized operators on AWS Graviton3 processors. Next comes the actual inference where the compiled graph is dispatched to be run. OneDNN with ACL was the backend we chose during the inductor compilation, so, the new operators were dispatched to oneDNN as expected, for example, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mkldnn._linear_pointwise&lt;/code&gt;. However, due to gaps in oneDNN ACL primitives, the operators were run with C++ reference kernels instead of the optimized ACL kernels. Hence, the compile performance was still significantly behind the eager mode performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were mainly three areas where oneDNN ACL primitives lack support for torch.compile mode. The following section talks about them in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. ACL primitives didn’t have support for weights in blocked layout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACL primitives originally designed for eager mode supported weights only in the standard channels last (&lt;a href=&quot;https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/dev_guide_understanding_memory_formats.html#nhwc&quot;&gt;NHWC&lt;/a&gt;) format, without any pre-packing. Whereas weights pre-packing into blocked layout is one of the main optimizations in the inductor compilation passes where the weights are reordered into blocks specific to the runtime platform. This avoids the redundant and on-the-fly reorders when running the General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM), which otherwise would be the bottleneck for inference performance. But the ACL primitives didn’t have support for blocked layout and hence the operators were run with oneDNN C++ reference kernels instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Mixed precision primitives weren’t supported in oneDNN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AWS Graviton3 processors support &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0596/2020-12/SVE-Instructions/BFMMLA--BFloat16-floating-point-matrix-multiply-accumulate-&quot;&gt;bfloat16 MMLA instructions&lt;/a&gt; which can be used to accelerate fp32 inference with bfloat16 GEMM as a mixed precision compute. ACL supports bfloat16 mixed precision GEMM kernels, and are integrated into oneDNN as a fast math compute option for the existing fp32 operators. However, the fast math approach didn’t work for compile mode because of weights pre-packing optimization. The compile mode requires explicit mixed precision primitive implementation in oneDNN in order to use bfloat16 acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. ACL primitives didn’t support fused kernels for some of the activation functions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In eager mode, operators are dispatched individually because the model is run independently as soon as it’s reached. Whereas in compile mode, operator fusion is another important optimization where the operators are fused for runtime efficiency. For example, Gaussian Error Linear Unit (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08415.pdf#%3A~%3Atext%3DWe%20propose%20the%20Gaussian%20Error%2Cstandard%20Gaussian%20cumulative%20distribution%20function&quot;&gt;GELU&lt;/a&gt;) is one of the most widely used activation functions in transformers-based neural network architectures. So, it’s typical to have a linear layer (with matrix multiplications) followed by GELU activation. As part of compiling the model into efficient operators, the torch inductor fuses matmul and GELU into a single linearpointwise+gelu operator. However, oneDNN ACL primitives didn’t have the support for fused kernels with GELU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We addressed these gaps by extending oneDNN primitives to handle the additional layouts and new primitive definitions. The following sections talk about the optimizations in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optimization-1-extended-acl-primitives-to-accept-weight-tensors-in-blocked-layout&quot;&gt;Optimization 1: Extended ACL primitives to accept weight tensors in blocked layout&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We extended the ACL primitives to accept blocked layout in addition to the the standard NHWC format. The code snippet for this is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;const bool is_weights_md_format_ok
                    = utils::one_of(weights_format_kind_received,
                      format_kind::any, format_kind::blocked);


const memory_desc_t weights_md_received = weights_md_;
acl_utils::reorder_to_weight_format(aip.wei_tensor_info,
             weights_md_, expected_weight_format, inner_dim, o_dim,
             remaining_dims, {});

ACL_CHECK_SUPPORT(
     (weights_format_kind_received == format_kind::blocked)
      &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !(dnnl_memory_desc_equal(
      &amp;amp;weights_md_received, &amp;amp;weights_md_)),
      &quot;specified blocked format not supported by ACL, use &quot;
      &quot;format_kind_t::any to find a supported blocked format for &quot;
      &quot;your platform&quot;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optimization-2-defined-new-acl-primitives-to-handle-mixed-precision-operators-weights-in-bfloat16-and-activations-in-fp32&quot;&gt;Optimization 2: Defined new ACL primitives to handle mixed precision operators (weights in bfloat16 and activations in fp32)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We defined mixed precision primitive definitions and updated the existing oneDNN ACL fp32 primitives to handle bfloat16 tensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; /* With graph compilation, we are able to reorder and pre-pack the weights during the model load
  * and compilation phase itself so that redundant and on-the-fly reorders can be avoided.
  * This primitive definition is to support gemm fastmath mode for the compile scenario where src is
  * in fp32 and weights are in bf16
  */
 {{forward, f32, bf16, f32}, {
    CPU_INSTANCE_AARCH64_ACL(acl_inner_product_fwd_t)
    nullptr,
 }},
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optimization-3-disabled-operator-fusion-pass-in-torch-inductor&quot;&gt;Optimization 3: Disabled operator fusion pass in torch inductor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We bypassed the operator fusion pass in torch inductor so that the compiled graph doesn’t contain GELU fused operators. This is a temporary solution to enable ACL kernels in torch.compile. There is a work in progress to enable operator fusion pass for the future PyTorch releases. With this workaround, we were able to successfully dispatch the linear layer to ACL. As shown in the following torch.profiler output, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aten::addmm &lt;/code&gt;(one of the variants of the matmul operator) and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;aten::gelu &lt;/code&gt;in the original model (as highlighted in &lt;em&gt;Image 4&lt;/em&gt;) was compiled to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mkldnn::_linear_pointwise &lt;/code&gt;without &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gelu &lt;/code&gt;operator fusion (as highlighted in &lt;em&gt;Image 5&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gelu &lt;/code&gt;operator was compiled into &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;erf &lt;/code&gt;(error function) and was dispatched to an inductor auto vectorization backend. The following snippets show the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;erf &lt;/code&gt;operator in the compiled graph and running it using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;libm.so&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image 6&lt;/strong&gt;: snippet after post grad pass showing erf function in the compiled graph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mt-3 mb-3&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;     0.82%     0.40%  python3  libm.so.6            [.] erff32

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image 7&lt;/strong&gt;: Linux perf report showing erf dispatch to libm.so&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this work, we were able to optimize &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;torch.compile &lt;/code&gt;performance on Graviton3 processors by using inductor graph compilation along with the oneDNN+ACL backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;torchbench-enhancements&quot;&gt;TorchBench enhancements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the torch.compile performance improvements on AWS Graviton3 processors, we extended TorchBench framework to add a new argument to enable graph freeze and weights pre-packing and disable torch auto grad for eval test mode. The code snippet for this is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;parser.add_argument(
 &quot;—freeze_prepack_weights&quot;,
 action='store_true',
 help=&quot;set to freeze the graph and prepack weights&quot;,
 )

if args.freeze_prepack_weights:
 torch._inductor.config.freezing=True
 torch._inductor.config.cpp.weight_prepack=True
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image 8&lt;/strong&gt;: Added freeze_prepack_weights option for torchdynamo backend in TorchBench to demonstrate torch.compile performance improvements on AWS Graviton3 processors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have upstreamed all the optimizations, and starting with PyTorch 2.3.1, these are supported in torch Python wheels and AWS Graviton PyTorch DLC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we’re extending the torch inductor CPU backend support to compile Llama model, and adding support for fused GEMM kernels to enable torch inductor operator fusion optimization on AWS Graviton3 processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we covered how we optimized torch.compile performance on AWS Graviton3-based EC2 instances, how to use the optimizations to improve PyTorch model inference performance, and demonstrated the resulting speedups. We hope that you will give it a try!

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://pytorch.org/blog/training-moes/">&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have surged in popularity, fueled by powerful open-source models like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm&quot;&gt;DBRX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/&quot;&gt;Mixtral&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2&quot;&gt;DeepSeek&lt;/a&gt;, and many more. At Databricks, we’ve worked closely with the PyTorch team to scale training of MoE models. In this blog post, we’ll talk about how we scale to over three thousand GPUs using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dist_overview.html&quot;&gt;PyTorch Distributed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/databricks/megablocks&quot;&gt;MegaBlocks&lt;/a&gt;, an efficient open-source MoE implementation in PyTorch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-moe&quot;&gt;What is a MoE?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A MoE model is a model architecture that uses multiple expert networks to make predictions. A gating network is used to route and combine the outputs of experts, ensuring each expert is trained on a different, specialized distribution of tokens. The architecture of a transformer-based large language model typically consists of an embedding layer that leads into multiple transformer blocks (Figure 1, Subfigure A). Each transformer block contains an attention block and a dense feed forward network (Figure 1, Subfigure B). These transformer blocks are stacked such that the output of one transformer block leads to the input of the next block. The final output goes through a fully connected layer and softmax to obtain probabilities for the next token to output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using a MoE in LLMs, the dense feed forward layer is replaced by a MoE layer which consists of a gating network and a number of experts (Figure 1, Subfigure D). The gating network, typically a linear feed forward network, takes in each token and produces a set of weights that determine which tokens are routed to which experts. The experts themselves are typically implemented as a feed forward network as well. During training, the gating network adapts to assign inputs to the experts, enabling the model to specialize and improve its performance. The router outputs are then used to weigh expert outputs to give the final output of the MoE layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/training-moes/fg1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1: Using Mixture of Experts in a transformer block&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1: Using Mixture of Experts in a transformer block&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to dense models, MoEs provide more efficient training for a given compute budget. This is because the gating network only sends tokens to a subset of experts, reducing the computational load. As a result, the capacity of a model (its total number of parameters) can be increased without proportionally increasing the computational requirements. During inference, only some of the experts are used, so a MoE is able to perform faster inference than a dense model. However, the entire model needs to be loaded in memory, not just the experts being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sparsity in MoEs that allows for greater computational efficiency comes from the fact that a particular token will only be routed to a subset of experts. The number of experts and how experts are chosen depends on the implementation of the gating network, but a common method is top k. The gating network first predicts a probability value for each expert, then routes the token to the top k experts to obtain the output. However, if all tokens always go to the same subset of experts, training becomes inefficient and the other experts end up undertrained. To alleviate this problem, a load balancing loss is introduced that encourages even routing to all experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of experts and choosing the top k experts is an important factor in designing MoEs. A higher number of experts allows scaling up to larger models without increasing computational cost. This means that the model has a higher capacity for learning, however, past a certain point the performance gains tend to diminish. The number of experts chosen needs to be balanced with the inference costs of serving the model since the entire model needs to be loaded in memory. Similarly, when choosing top k, a lower top k during training results in smaller matrix multiplications, leaving free computation on the table if communication costs are large enough. During inference, however, a higher top k generally leads to slower inference speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;megablocks&quot;&gt;MegaBlocks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/databricks/megablocks&quot;&gt;MegaBlocks&lt;/a&gt; is an efficient MoE implementation that uses sparse matrix multiplication to compute expert outputs in parallel despite uneven token assignment. MegaBlocks implements a dropless MoE that avoids dropping tokens while using GPU kernels that maintain efficient training. Prior to MegaBlocks, dynamic routing formulations forced a tradeoff between model quality and hardware efficiency. Previously, users had to either drop tokens from computation or waste computation and memory on padding. Experts can receive a variable number of tokens and the expert computation can be performed efficiently using block sparse matrix multiplication. We’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.databricks.com/blog/bringing-megablocks-databricks&quot;&gt;integrated MegaBlocks into LLM Foundry&lt;/a&gt; to enable scaling MoE training to thousands of GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/training-moes/fg2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 2: Matrix multiplication for expert computations&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2: Matrix multiplication for expert computations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expert-parallelism&quot;&gt;Expert Parallelism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As models scale to larger sizes and fail to fit on a single GPU, we require more advanced forms of parallelism. Expert parallelism is a form of model parallelism where we place different experts on different GPUs for better performance. Instead of expert weights being communicated across all GPUs, tokens are sent to the device that contains the expert. By moving data instead of weights, we can aggregate data across multiple machines for a single expert. The router determines which tokens from the input sequence should be sent to which experts. This is typically done by computing a gating score for each token-expert pair, and then routing each token to the top-scoring experts. Once the token-to-expert assignments are determined, an all-to-all communication step is performed to dispatch the tokens to the devices hosting the relevant experts. This involves each device sending the tokens assigned to experts on other devices, while receiving tokens assigned to its local experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key advantage of expert parallelism is processing a few, larger matrix multiplications instead of several small matrix multiplications. As each GPU only has a subset of experts, it only has to do computation for those experts. Correspondly, as we aggregate tokens across multiple GPUs, the size of each matrix is proportionally larger. As GPUs are optimized for large-scale parallel computations, larger operations can better exploit their capabilities, leading to higher utilization and efficiency. A more in depth explanation of the benefits of larger matrix multiplications can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thonking.ai/p/what-shapes-do-matrix-multiplications&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Once the computation is complete, another all-to-all communication step is performed to send the expert outputs back to their original devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/training-moes/fg3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 3: Token routing in expert parallelism&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3: Token routing in expert parallelism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We leverage PyTorch’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/distributed/_tensor/README.md&quot;&gt;DTensor&lt;/a&gt;, a low-level abstraction for describing how tensors are sharded and replicated, to effectively implement expert parallelism. We first manually place experts on different GPUs, typically sharding across a node to ensure we can leverage NVLink for fast GPU communication when we route tokens. We can then build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/distributed_device_mesh.html&quot;&gt;device mesh&lt;/a&gt; on top of this layout, which lets us succinctly describe the parallelism across the entire cluster. We can use this device mesh to easily checkpoint or rearrange experts when we need alternate forms of parallelism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scaling-zero-3-with-pytorch-fsdp&quot;&gt;Scaling ZeRO-3 with PyTorch FSDP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with expert parallelism, we use data parallelism for all other layers, where each GPU stores a copy of the model and optimizer and processes a different chunk of data. After each GPU has completed a forward and backward pass, gradients are accumulated across GPUs for a global model update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZeRO-3 is a form of data parallelism where weights and optimizers are sharded across each GPU instead of being replicated. Each GPU now only stores a subset of the full model, dramatically reducing memory pressure. When a part of the model is needed for computation, it is gathered across all the GPUs, and after the computation is complete, the gathered weights are discarded. We use PyTorch’s implementation of ZeRO-3, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-pytorch-fully-sharded-data-parallel-api/&quot;&gt;Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we scale to thousands of GPUs, the cost of communication across devices increases, slowing down training. Communication increases due to the need to synchronize and share model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across all GPUs which involves all-gather and reduce-scatter operations. To mitigate this issue while keeping the benefits of FSDP, we utilize Hybrid Sharded Data Parallel (HSDP) to shard the model and optimizer across a set number of GPUs and replicate this multiple times to fully utilize the cluster. With HSDP, an additional all reduce operation is needed in the backward pass to sync gradients across replicas. This approach allows us to balance memory efficiency and communication cost during large scale distributed training. To use HSDP we can extend our previous device mesh from expert parallelism and let PyTorch do the heavy lifting of actually sharding and gathering when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/training-moes/fg4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 4: FSDP and HSDP&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4: FSDP and HSDP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With PyTorch, we can effectively combine these two types of parallelism, leveraging FSDP’s higher level API while using the lower-level &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/distributed/_tensor/README.md&quot;&gt;DTensor&lt;/a&gt; abstraction when we want to implement something custom like expert parallelism. We now have a 3D device mesh with expert parallel shard dimension, ZeRO-3 shard dimension, and a replicate dimension for pure data parallelism. Together, these techniques deliver near linear scaling across very large clusters, allowing us to achieve MFU numbers over 40%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elastic-checkpointing-with-torch-distributed&quot;&gt;Elastic Checkpointing with Torch Distributed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fault tolerance is crucial for ensuring that LLMs can be trained reliably over extended periods, especially in distributed environments where node failures are common. To avoid losing progress when jobs inevitably encounter failures, we checkpoint the state of the model, which includes parameters, optimizer states, and other necessary metadata. When a failure occurs, the system can resume from the last saved state rather than starting over. To ensure robustness to failures, we need to checkpoint often and save and load checkpoints in the most performant way possible to minimize downtime. Additionally, if too many GPUs fail, our cluster size may change. Accordingly, we need the ability to elastically resume on a different number of GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyTorch supports elastic checkpointing through its distributed training framework, which includes utilities for both saving and loading checkpoints across different cluster configurations. PyTorch Distributed Checkpoint ensures the model’s state can be saved and restored accurately across all nodes in the training cluster in parallel, regardless of any changes in the cluster’s composition due to node failures or additions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, when training very large models, the size of checkpoints may be very large, leading to very slow checkpoint upload and download times. PyTorch Distributed Checkpoint supports sharded checkpoints, which enables each GPU to save and load only its portion of the model. When combining sharded checkpointing with elastic training, each GPU reads the metadata file to determine which shards to download on resumption. The metadata file contains information on what parts of each tensor are stored in each shard. The GPU can then download the shards for its part of the model and load that part of the checkpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/training-moes/fg5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 5: Checkpointing saving and resumption resharded on additional GPUs&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5: Checkpointing saving and resumption resharded on additional GPUs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By parallelizing checkpointing across GPUs, we can spread out network load, improving robustness and speed. When training a model with 3000+ GPUs, network bandwidth quickly becomes a bottleneck. We take advantage of the replication in HSDP to first download checkpoints on one replica and then send the necessary shards to other replicas. With our integration in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mosaicml/composer&quot;&gt;Composer&lt;/a&gt;, we can reliably upload checkpoints to cloud storage as frequently as every 30 minutes and automatically resume from the latest checkpoint in the event of a node failure in less than 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re very excited to see how PyTorch is enabling training state-of-the-art LLMs with great performance. In our post, we’ve shown how we implemented efficient MoE training through Pytorch Distributed and MegaBlocks on Foundry. Furthermore, Pytorch elastic checkpointing allowed us to quickly resume training on a different number of GPUs when node failures occurred. Using Pytorch HSDP has allowed us to scale training efficiently as well as improve checkpointing resumption times. We look forward to continuing building on a strong and vibrant open-source community to help bring great AI models to everyone. Come join us in building great models at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mosaicml/llm-foundry&quot;&gt;LLM Foundry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch&quot;&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <link href="https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-neural-network-training/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Accelerating Neural Network Training with Semi-Structured (2:4) Sparsity" />
      <published>2024-06-20T00:00:00-07:00</published>
      <updated>2024-06-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-neural-network-training/">&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we’ve added support for semi-structured (2:4) sparsity into PyTorch. With just a few lines of code, we were able to show a 10% end-to-end inference speedup on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pytorch/ao/tree/main/torchao/sparsity#segment-anything&quot;&gt;segment-anything&lt;/a&gt; by replacing dense matrix multiplications with sparse matrix multiplications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, matrix multiplications are not unique to neural network inference - they happen during training as well. By expanding on the core primitives we used earlier to accelerate inference, we were also able to accelerate model training. We wrote a replacement nn.Linear layer, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SemiSparseLinear&lt;/code&gt;, that is able to achieve a 1.3x &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pytorch/ao/tree/main/torchao/sparsity/training#benchmarking&quot;&gt;speedup&lt;/a&gt; across the forwards + backwards pass of the linear layers in the MLP block of ViT-L on a NVIDIA A100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-to-end, we see a wall time reduction of 6% for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2&quot;&gt;DINOv2 ViT-L&lt;/a&gt; training, with virtually no accuracy degradation out of the box (82.8 vs 82.7 on ImageNet top-1 accuracy).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/accelerating-neural-network-training/fg1.png&quot; alt=&quot;2 strategies for training a ViT model&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We compare 2 strategies for training a ViT model for 125k iterations on 4x NVIDIA A100s: either fully dense (blue), or sparse for 70% of the training, then dense (orange). Both achieve similar results on the benchmarks, but the sparse variant trains 6% faster. For both experiments, we evaluate the intermediate checkpoints with and without sparsity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as we are aware, &lt;strong&gt;this is the first OSS implementation of accelerated sparse training&lt;/strong&gt; and we’re excited to provide a user API in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pytorch/ao/tree/main/torchao/sparsity/training#benchmarking&quot;&gt;torchao&lt;/a&gt;. You can try accelerating your own training runs with just a few lines of code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-py highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Requires torchao and pytorch nightlies and CUDA compute capability 8.0+

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;swap_linear_with_semi_sparse_linear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;torch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Sequential&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;torch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Linear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4096&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cuda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;half&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Specify the fully-qualified-name of the nn.Linear modules you want to swap
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sparse_config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;seq.0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SemiSparseLinear&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Swap nn.Linear with SemiSparseLinear, you can run your normal training loop after this step
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;swap_linear_with_semi_sparse_linear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sparse_config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-this-work&quot;&gt;How does this work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general idea behind sparsity is simple: skip calculations involving zero-valued tensor elements to speed up matrix multiplication. However, simply setting weights to zero isn’t enough, as the dense tensor still contains these pruned elements and dense matrix multiplication kernels will continue to process them, incurring the same latency and memory overhead. To achieve actual performance gains, we need to replace dense kernels with sparse kernels that intelligently bypass calculations involving pruned elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These kernels work on sparse matrices, which remove the pruned elements and store the specified elements in a compressed format. There are many different sparse formats, but we’re particularly interested in &lt;strong&gt;semi-structured sparsity,&lt;/strong&gt; also known as &lt;strong&gt;2:4 structured sparsity&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;fine-grained structured sparsity&lt;/strong&gt; or more generally &lt;strong&gt;N:M structured sparsity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/accelerating-neural-network-training/fg2.png&quot; alt=&quot;2:4 sparse compressed representation&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;display:block;max-width:600px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2:4 sparse compressed representation. Original &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/structured-sparsity-in-the-nvidia-ampere-architecture-and-applications-in-search-engines/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2:4-sparse matrix is a matrix where at most 2 elements are non-zero for every 4 elements, as illustrated in the image above. Semi-structured sparsity is attractive because it exists in a goldilocks spot of performance and accuracy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NVIDIA GPUs since Ampere offer hardware acceleration and library support (&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusparselt/index.html&quot;&gt;cuSPARSELt&lt;/a&gt;) for this format, with matrix multiplication being up to 1.6x faster&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pruning models to fit this sparsity pattern does not degrade accuracy as much as other patterns. NVIDIA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08378&quot;&gt;whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; shows pruning then retraining is able to recover accuracy for most vision models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/accelerating-neural-network-training/fg3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Illustration of 2:4 (sparse) matrix multiplication on NVIDIA GPUs&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accelerating inference with semi-structured sparsity is straightforward. Since our weights are fixed during inference, we can prune and compress the weight ahead of time (offline) and store the compressed sparse representation instead of our dense tensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/accelerating-neural-network-training/fg4.png&quot; alt=&quot;flow chart&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, instead of dispatching to dense matrix multiplication we dispatch to sparse matrix multiplication, passing in the compressed sparse weight instead of the normal dense one. For more information about accelerating models for inference using 2:4 sparsity, please refer to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/semi_structured_sparse.html?highlight=beta&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;extending-sparse-inference-acceleration-to-training&quot;&gt;Extending sparse inference acceleration to training&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to use sparsity to reduce the training time of our models, we need to consider when the mask is calculated, as once we store the compressed representation the mask is fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training with a fixed mask applied to an existing trained dense model (also known as &lt;strong&gt;pruning&lt;/strong&gt;) does not degrade accuracy, but this requires two training runs - one to obtain the dense model and another to make it sparse, offering no speedups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead we’d like to train a sparse model from scratch (&lt;strong&gt;dynamic sparse training&lt;/strong&gt;), but training from scratch with a fixed mask will lead to a significant drop in evaluations, as the sparsity mask would be selected at initialization, when the model weights are essentially random.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maintain the accuracy of the model when training from scratch, we prune and compress the weights at runtime, so that we can calculate the optimal mask at each step of the training process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually you can think of our approach as an approximate matrix multiplication technique, where we &lt;code&gt;`prune_and_compress`&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;and dispatch to &lt;code&gt;`sparse_GEMM`&lt;/code&gt; in less time than a &lt;code&gt;`dense_GEMM`&lt;/code&gt; call would take. This is difficult because the native pruning and compression functions are too slow to show speedups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the shapes of our ViT-L training matrix multiplications (13008x4096x1024), we measured the runtime of a dense and sparse GEMM respectively at 538us and 387us. In other words, the pruning and compression step of the weight matrix must run in less than 538-387=151us to have any efficiency gain. Unfortunately, the compression kernel provided in cuSPARSELt already takes 380us (without even considering the pruning step!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the max NVIDIA A100 memory IO (2TB/s), and considering that a prune and compress kernel would be memory bound, we could theoretically prune and compress our weight (4096x1024x2 bytes=8MB) in 4us (8MB / 2TB/s)! And in fact, we were able to write a kernel that prunes and compresses a matrix into 2:4-sparse format, and runs in 36 us (10x faster than the compression kernel in cuSPARSELt), making the entire GEMM (including the sparsification) faster. Our kernel is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/122350&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; for use in PyTorch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/accelerating-neural-network-training/fg5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our custom sparsification kernel&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our custom sparsification kernel, which includes pruning + compression, is ~30% faster across a linear layer forward+backward. Benchmarks run on a NVIDIA A100-80GB GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;writing-a-performant-runtime-sparsification-kernel&quot;&gt;Writing a performant runtime sparsification kernel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were multiple challenges we faced in order to implement a performant runtime sparsification kernel, which we will explore below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-handling-the-backwards-pass&quot;&gt;1) Handling the backwards pass&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the backwards pass, we need to calculate dL/dX and dL/dW for the gradient update and the subsequent layer, which means we need to calculate xW&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; and x&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;W respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/accelerating-neural-network-training/fg6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Overview of runtime sparsification for training acceleration (FW + BW pass)&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overview of runtime sparsification for training acceleration (FW + BW pass)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However this is problematic, because the compressed representation cannot be transposed, since there’s no guarantee that the tensor is 2:4 sparse in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/accelerating-neural-network-training/fg7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Both matrices are valid 2:4 matrices. However, the right one is no longer a valid 2:4 matrix once transposed because one column contains more than 2 elements&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;display:block;max-width:500px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both matrices are valid 2:4 matrices. However, the right one is no longer a valid 2:4 matrix once transposed because one column contains more than 2 elements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we prune a 4x4 tile, instead of a 1x4 strip. We greedily preserve the largest values, ensuring that we take at most 2 values for each row / column. While this approach is not guaranteed to be optimal, as we sometimes only preserve 7 values instead of 8, it efficiently calculates a tensor that is 2:4 sparse both row-wise and column-wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then compress both the packed tensor and the packed transpose tensor, storing the transpose tensor for the backwards pass. By calculating both the packed and packed transpose tensor at the same time, we avoid a secondary kernel call in the backwards pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/accelerating-neural-network-training/fg8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our kernel prunes the weight matrix in registers&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our kernel prunes the weight matrix in registers, and writes the compressed values in global memory. It also prunes at the same time W.t, which is needed for the backward pass, minimizing the memory IO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s some additional transpose trickery needed to handle the backwards pass - the underlying hardware only supports operations where the first matrix is sparse. For weight sparsification during inference, when we need to calculate xW&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; we rely on transpose properties to swap the order of the operands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/accelerating-neural-network-training/fg1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Math formula&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;display:block;max-width:300px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During inference, we use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;torch.compile&lt;/code&gt; to fuse the outer transpose into subsequent pointwise ops in order to avoid paying a performance penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However in the case of the backwards pass of training, we have no subsequent pointwise op to fuse with. Instead, we fuse the transposition into our matrix multiplication by taking advantage of cuSPARSELt’s ability to specify the row / column layout of the result matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-kernel-tiling-for-efficient-memory-io&quot;&gt;2) Kernel tiling for efficient memory-IO&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for our kernel to be as efficient as possible, we want to coalesce our reads / writes, as we found that memory IO to be the main bottleneck. This means that within a CUDA thread, we want to read/write chunks of 128 bytes at a time, so that multiple parallel reads/writes can be coalesced into a single request by the GPU memory controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, instead of a thread handling a single 4x4 tile, which is only 4x4x2 = 32 bytes, we decided that each thread will handle 4 4x4 tiles (aka an 8x8 tile), which allows us to operate 8x8x2 =128 byte chunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/accelerating-neural-network-training/fg9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kernel tiling for efficient memory-IO&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-sorting-elements-in-a-4x4-tile-without-warp-divergence&quot;&gt;3) Sorting elements in a 4x4 tile without warp-divergence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each individual 4x4 tile within our thread we calculate a bitmask that specifies which elements to prune and which elements to keep. To do this we sort all 16 elements and greedily preserve elements, so long as they do not break our 2:4 row / col constraint. This preserves only the weights with the largest values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially we observe that we are only ever sorting a fixed number of elements, so by using a branchless &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_network&quot;&gt;sorting network&lt;/a&gt;, we can avoid warp divergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/accelerating-neural-network-training/fg10.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sorting network diagram&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For clarity, the transposed packed tensor and metadata are omitted. Sorting network diagram taken from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_network&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warp divergence occurs when we have conditional execution inside across a thread block. In CUDA, work items in the same work group (thread block) are dispatched at the hardware level in batches (warps). If we have conditional execution, such that some work-items in the same batch run different instructions, then they are masked when the warp is dispatched, or dispatched sequentially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if we have some code like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if (condition) do(A) else do(B)&lt;/code&gt;, where condition is satisfied by all the odd-numbered work items, then the total runtime of this conditional statement is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;do(A) + do(B)&lt;/code&gt;, since we would dispatch &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;do(A)&lt;/code&gt; for all odd-numbered work-items, masking out even-numbered work-items, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;do(B)&lt;/code&gt; for all even numbered work-items, masking out odd-numbered work-items. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CUDA/comments/gkpjxe/what_is_warp_divergence/#:~:text=Warp%20divergence%20is%20a%20%22Compute,later%20processed%20using%20different%20instructions.&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; provides more information about warp divergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-writing-the-compressed-matrices-and-metadata&quot;&gt;4) Writing the compressed matrices and metadata&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the bitmask has been computed, the weight data has to be written back in a compressed format in global memory. This is not trivial, because the data needs to stay in registers, and it’s not possible to index registers (eg &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;C[i++] = a&lt;/code&gt; prevents us from storing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; in registers). Furthermore, we found that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nvcc&lt;/code&gt; was using many more registers than we expected, which caused register spilling and impacted global performance. We write this compressed matrix to global memory in Column-Major format to make the writes more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/accelerating-neural-network-training/fg11.png&quot; alt=&quot;compressed matrix to global memory in Column-Major format&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to write the cuSPARSELt metadata as well. This metadata layout is quite similar to the one from the open-source CUTLASS library and is optimized for being loaded efficiently through shared-memory in the GEMM kernel with the PTX &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ldmatrix&lt;/code&gt; instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this layout is not optimized to be written efficiently: the first 128 bits of the metadata tensor contains metadata about the first 32 columns of the rows 0, 8, 16 and 24. Recall that each thread handles an 8x8 tile, which means that this information is scattered across 16 threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rely on a series of warp-shuffle operations, once for the original and transposed representation respectively to write the metadata. Fortunately, this data represents less than 10% of the total IO, so we can afford to not fully coalesce the writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dinov2-sparse-training-experimental-setup-and-results&quot;&gt;DINOv2 Sparse Training: Experimental Setup and Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our experiments, the ViT-L model is trained on ImageNet for 125k steps using the DINOv2 method. All our experiments were run on 4x AMD EPYC 7742 64-core CPUs and 4x NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs. During sparse training, the model is trained with 2:4 sparsity enabled for the first part of the training, where only half of the weights are enabled. This sparsity mask on the weights is dynamically recomputed at every step, as weights are continuously updated during the optimization. For the remaining steps, the model is trained densely, producing a final model without 2:4 sparsity (except the 100% sparse training setup), which is then evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the sparse training steps, in the backward pass we obtain a dense gradient for the sparse weights. For the gradient descent to be sound, we should also sparsify this gradient before using it in the optimizer to update the weights. Instead of doing that, we use the full dense gradient to update the weights - we found this to work better in practice: this is the STE (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05662&quot;&gt;Straight Through Estimator&lt;/a&gt;) strategy. In other words, we update all the parameters at every step, even the ones we don’t use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion-and-future-work&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Future Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we’ve shown how to accelerate neural network training with semi-structured sparsity and explained some of the challenges we faced. We were able to achieve a 6% end to end speedup on DINOv2 training with a small 0.1 pp accuracy drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several areas of expansion for this work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion to new sparsity patterns:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers have created new sparsity patterns like &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02065&quot;&gt;V:N:M&lt;/a&gt; sparsity that use the underlying semi-structured sparse kernels to allow for more flexibility. This is especially interesting for applying sparsity to LLMs, as 2:4 sparsity degrades accuracy too much, but we have seen some positive &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06927&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; for more general N:M pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance optimizations for sparse fine-tuning:&lt;/strong&gt; This post covers sparse training from scratch, but oftentimes we want to fine-tune a foundational model. In this case, a static mask may be sufficient to preserve accuracy which would enable us to make additional performance optimizations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More experiments on pruning strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; We calculate the mask at each step of the network, but calculating the mask every n steps may yield better training accuracy. Overall, figuring out the best strategy to use semi-structured sparsity during training is an open area of research.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compatibility with fp8:&lt;/strong&gt; The hardware also supports fp8 semi-structured sparsity, and this approach should work similarly with fp8 in principle. In practice, we would need to write similar sparsification kernels, and could possibly fuse them with the scaling of the tensors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activation Sparsity:&lt;/strong&gt; Efficient sparsification kernels also enable to sparsify the activations during training. Because the sparsification overhead grows linearly with the sparsified matrix size, setups with large activation tensors compared to the weight tensors could benefit more from activation sparsity than weight sparsity. Furthermore, activations are naturally sparse because of the usage of ReLU or GELU activation functions, reducing accuracy degradation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <link href="https://pytorch.org/blog/reducing-checkpointing-times/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reducing Model Checkpointing Times by Over 10x with PyTorch Distributed Asynchronous Checkpointing" />
      <published>2024-06-12T00:00:00-07:00</published>
      <updated>2024-06-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
      <id>https://pytorch.org/blog/reducing-checkpointing-times</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="https://pytorch.org/blog/reducing-checkpointing-times/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;   With PyTorch distributed’s new asynchronous checkpointing feature, developed with feedback from IBM, we show how IBM Research Team is able to implement and reduce effective checkpointing time by a factor of 10-20x.  Example: 7B model ‘down time’ for a checkpoint goes from an average of 148.8 seconds to 6.3 seconds, or 23.62x faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This directly translates into either more net training progress for every given 24 hour period while continuing to robustly checkpoint or more frequent checkpoints to shorten recovery window/time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this note, we showcase the usage code and architecture that makes asynchronous checkpointing possible, along with timing results verified by IBM’s Research team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/reducing-checkpointing-times/fg1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Async Checkpointing vs Standard Checkpointing&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Model checkpointing is a vital part of large model training, but checkpointing is an expensive process as each checkpoint process involves blocking training progress in order to save out the latest model weights.  However, not checkpointing or reducing checkpointing frequency can result in a significant loss in training progress. For example, failures such as a deadlock, straggler, and gpu errors require the training process to be restarted.  In order to restart from a failure, all (training) workers must stop their training process and be restarted from the last saved checkpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the inherent tension between robustness to failures vs training progress plays out as a tradeoff, but now with asynchronous checkpointing, PyTorch Distributed is able to significantly reduce this tension and enable frequent checkpoint with minimal impact to the overall training time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For background, it was almost exactly &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/blog/performant-distributed-checkpointing/&quot;&gt;a year ago&lt;/a&gt; that we showcased how distributed checkpointing had massively sped up checkpointing times from the original torch.save() functionality.  As IBM Research had noted, torch.save could take up to 30 minutes to checkpoint a single 11B model (PyTorch 1.13).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With advancements in distributed checkpointing, checkpoints could be done in under 4 minutes for up to 30B model sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With asynchronous checkpointing, the training time lost due to checkpointing now moves to under 30 seconds, and often as short as 6 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, asynchronous checkpointing does not compress the actual serialization checkpointing time as the previous update showcased.  Rather it moves the final checkpointing process off the critical path (to cpu threads) to allow GPU training to continue while finalizing the checkpoint under separate threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to the user, the effect is nearly the same in that down time for training due to checkpointing is substantially reduced, in many cases by 10x or even 20x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/reducing-checkpointing-times/fg2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Async Dist Checkpointing&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the above speedup chart shows, asynchronous checkpointing produces a 10x to 23x further improvement over the previous large improvements from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-asynchronous-checkpointing-work&quot;&gt;How does Asynchronous Checkpointing work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous checkpointing modularizes the checkpointing process into two parts rather than one monolithic process.  The first phase copies the data from each gpu/rank from GPU to CPU.  This is the visible downtime to the user and can take from 6 - 14 seconds for 7B-13B model sizes. The second phase asynchronously copies the data from CPU memory to disk to persist the checkpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once data is copied to CPU in the first phase, the GPU is free to immediately resume training.  Hence with asynchronous checkpointing the downtime for checkpointing is simply the time needed to copy over the latest model states to CPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time that training resumes, non-blocking CPU threads work with the freshly arrived data in memory to complete the full checkpointing/serialization process to disk (i.e. persistent save).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/reducing-checkpointing-times/fg3.png&quot; alt=&quot;flow diagram&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that PyTorch’s Distributed Checkpointer relies on collective communication calls for per-rank metadata necessary to optimize saves, as well as a final synchronization which marks checkpointing as complete and makes the action atomic. This can interfere with distributed training (as distributed training also relies upon similar calls to synchronize training across multiple GPUs) if the Checkpointing thread utilizes the same process group used for training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, a race condition between the calls could potentially cause training and asynch checkpointing save threads to wait on collective calls at the same time, resulting in a true collective hang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We avoided this scenario by initializing a separate process group for async checkpointing.  This separates the checkpointing collectives into their own logical process group, which thus ensures it will not interfere with collective calls in the main training threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-use-asynchronous-checkpointing-in-my-training&quot;&gt;How do I use Asynchronous Checkpointing in my training?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usage of Asynchronous checkpointing is relatively straightforward.  Using the latest nightly version of PyTorch, you will want to initialize your process group with both nccl and gloo.  Gloo is required for the cpu threads portion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, create a duplicate process group which the asynchronous checkpointing will utilize.
Then train as usual but at the point when you want to checkpoint, use the asynchronous save api, passing in the states to save, the checkpoint id and the checkpoint process group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/reducing-checkpointing-times/fg4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Code snippet&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous checkpointing is also fully implemented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan&quot;&gt;torchtitan&lt;/a&gt;.  Here, it is implemented for use with pre-training your own Llama2 or Lllama3 model.  Using it is as simple as updating the toml config file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/reducing-checkpointing-times/fg5.png&quot; alt=&quot;Code snippet&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-work&quot;&gt;Future work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checkpointing has made huge strides over the past year.  Moving from almost half an hour checkpoints to under 5 minutes with distributed checkpointing and now to under 30 seconds with asynchronous checkpointing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last frontier - zero overhead checkpointing where even the &amp;lt; 30 seconds is eliminated by streaming the updated weights during the backward pass such that checkpoint data is already on cpu at the point asynchronous checkpointing would kick in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would effectively move large model training to where checkpointing has no disruption or downtime enabling both more robustness (as checkpoints could be taken more frequently) and faster training progress due to no downtime for checkpointing.&lt;/p&gt;
